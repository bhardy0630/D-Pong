Each contribution to the project must be a minimum of 5 lines of code.
If there are any issues, please communicate them with the group.
Any major suggestions should be brought up to the group for discussion.
Whoever makes the first substantial Unity contribution (10 lines of code) will be given a free x-large pizza from Papa Johns by Jaaz.
If Jaaz makes the first contribution, he eats the pizza himself.
